* [Classes](content/Classes/Classes.q.md) **55 minutes**
    > Classes are blueprints for objects. In this lesson, you will learn the basic building blocks of a class, its capabilities, and its uses.  

* [Objects](content/Objects/Objects.q.md) **57 minutes**
    > Objects are the actual representation of a class. Discover how you can create objects from a class using the `new` keyword.

* [Objects and References](content/ObjectsAndReferences/ObjectsAndReferences.q.md) **50 minutes**
    > Discover how a variable and an object are managed in the memory during program execution.

* [Properties](content/Properties/Properties.q.md) **52 minutes**
    > Properties are the variables defined inside a class. In this lesson, you will learn how to add properties to a class. 

* [Methods](content/Methods/Methods.q.md) **1 hour and 15 minutes**
    > Methods are one of the basic building blocks of classes. In this lesson, you will learn how to add methods to a class. 

* [Visibility](content/Visibility/Visibility.q.md) **55 minutes**
    > Explore the things you can do to manipulate the methods and properties of a class. In this lesson, you will learn what visibility is, how it works, and why it is important in Object-Oriented PHP.

* [Encapsulation](content/Encapsulation/Encapsulation.q.md) **50 minutes**
    > Discover how you can hide the internal implementation of an object from other objects for protection purposes.

* [Constructor](content/Constructor/Constructor.q.md) **1 hour and 5 minutes**
    > Learn how you can use the `__construct()` method to define a constructor for a class.

* [Inheritance](content/Inheritance/Inheritance.q.md) **1 hour and 15 minutes**
    > Discover how classes inherit the methods and properties of another class using the `extends` keyword.

* [Abstract Classes and Methods](content/AbstractClassesAndMethods/AbstractClassesAndMethods.q.md) **45 minutes**
    > Learn how you can use the `abstract` keyword to declare classes and methods as `abstract`.

* [Interfaces](content/Interfaces/Interfaces.q.md) **1 hour and 10 minutes**
    > Interfaces are outlines of what an object can do. In this lesson, you will learn how to work with `interfaces` to define `public methods` that a class must `implement`.

* [Polymorphism](content/Polymorphism/Polymorphism.q.md) **45 minutes**
    > Discover how a method behaves differently based on the specified instance.

* [Static Methods and Properties](content/StaticMethodsAndProperties/StaticMethodsAndProperties.q.md) **1 hour and 20 minutes**
    > Discover how you can make class properties and methods accessible without an instance of the created object. 

* [Constants](content/Constants/Constants.q.md) **58 minutes**
    > In this lesson, you will learn how to declare and access constants within classes.

* [Autoloading Classes](content/AutoloadingClasses/AutoloadingClasses.q.md) **1 hour and 5 minutes**
    > Discover how you can organize and load class files automatically using the `spl_autoload_register()` function.

* [Namespaces](content/Namespaces/Namespaces.q.md) **1 hour and 15 minutes**
    > Discover how you can group related classes, interfaces, methods, and constants using the `namespace` keyword.
