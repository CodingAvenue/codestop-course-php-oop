### Facts for Classes lesson:

A class is a blueprint that defines the characteristics and behaviors of all objects of a specific kind. It has properties and methods as its basic building blocks.

A property is a variable that is defined inside a class. 

A method is a function inside a class that performs a specific action.

To declare a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name, and a pair of curly braces `{}` that enclose the definition of the `properties` and `methods` of a class. 

The following is an example of a class declaration:

```php
class MyClass {
    // properties and methods here...
}
```

A class name may start with a letter or an underscore `_`, followed by any combination of alphanumeric characters and underscores (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`). 

It is good practice to capitalize the first letter of a class name to easily identify them from other variables. Some examples of good class names are `MyClass`, `SuperHero`, and `Car`.
